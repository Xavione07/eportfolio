<p>I was born in Brooklyn New York on July 20,2005. 
I am an aspiring Computer Programmer and am currently studying at BMCC. 
Some of my intrest are watching sports, playing games, programming, drawing and hanging out with friends. 
As a child I would always find myself intrested in basketball and video games above all other intrests. 
Some of my favorite games are The Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask and Kirby's dream land. 

I would always find myself immersed in the world of video games and would always find myself playing hours on end. It's the least to say that video games helped shape who I am today. 
Not only did video games help shape my life but the sport of basketball as well. 
As a kid it's without a doubt important to strive for a career path or have aspirations for being someone, especially if you had an idol you looked up to. 
In my case I looked up to the stars of the NBA. 
Players like Lebron James and James Harden were always people I aspired to be but everything isn't always planned out fully and eventually I let go of my aspirations of becoming an NBA star.

My one wish in life is to make my parents happy and to provide the same love and care as they did for me. 
Being a teenager going through some hormonal changes within my body, looking back at it, I feel as if I wasnt making the best decisions in life. 
I burdened my parents so many times and so I want to make something of myself and make them proud.
